#### Amazon Review Rating Prediction

With the e-commerce boom, there are multiple products available to consumers. While deciding the best product as well as recommending products for the user e-commerce enterprises rely on the product review. Having these product review data in good quality will also help analytic teams to come up with a better model. I am using amazon product reviews for the analysis. I will be using existing reviews to find the review rating based on the text. The review rating ranges from 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest, and 5 is the max rating. For example, if the review contains the text “Good product to be used.” The model will try to see what can be the review rating for this review. This will help improve the quality of data by detecting review ratings based on review text if it is missing. As well as ensure that the review ratings are in compliant with review text.
