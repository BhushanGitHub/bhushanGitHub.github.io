#### Brain Tumor Image Classification

Images are used in various fields to make the problem easier to understand. Image processing techniques are most widely used in medical imaging to identify the affected area through an X-ray, computed tomography scan(CT scan), MRI scan(Magnetic resonance images). These images are used to detect, identify, and locate infections, abnormal growths from the human body. Heart diseases, Cancer, Brain tumor, Blood clotting, these are some of the abnormalities that can be found by medical imaging techniques. We can use different machine learning techniques to classify different types of brain tumors by using MRI. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a class of deep learning neural networks that are highly effective with image classifications.
