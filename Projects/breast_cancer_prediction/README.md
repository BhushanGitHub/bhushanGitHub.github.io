#### Breast Cancer Prediction

Lifetime breast cancer risk in U.S. women is 1 in 8 that is about 13%. In 2021 it is expected that the US will add 281,550 cases of breast cancer in women. If it can be detected and treated early, studies show that these statistics can be improved. The purpose of this project was to determine if machines can accurately assist doctors, particularly breast cancer specialists, in making an accurate predictive diagnosis relating to breast cancer.
