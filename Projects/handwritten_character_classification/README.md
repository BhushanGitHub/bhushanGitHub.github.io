#### Handwritten Character Classification

Handwritten character recognition is an important part in computer vision domain. Handwritten character recognition is least explored for the Devnagari character (Indian Language). There are different techniques used in handwritten character recognition. Several researches have been done to develop a system which will provide a good accuracy. There are two techniques of character recognition system namely online and offline character recognition. Here we used offline handwritten character system. In offline character recognition system handwritten characters of user are available as image. Handwritten character recognition can benefit multiple industries. Some of those are - ***Consumer*** : With smartphone and tablets, consumer industry need something to minimize spelling mistakes on digital keyboards and handwritten character recognition can help in great way. ***Education***: Using handwritten technology, students can benefit from more than just the increased comprehension linked to taking handwritten notes. Handwritten technology is can be used in note taking, math and even music apps. For this character classification problem, the dataset used is having 78,200 images of 46 Devnagari characters. The data is split into training and testing set for model training and verification. Using current advancement in Deep learning using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) helped to achieve greater accuracy.
