#### Stock Price Analysis

Stock price analysis based on its open, high, low, and close values is referred to as a Technical analysis of a stock. I am planning to do a stockâ€™s Technical analysis to help investors/traders make data-driven decisions. Also doing chart-based analysis for each stock is time-consuming and if it can be programmed multiple stocks can be analyzed with speed. As an example, I am choosing stock data for the Zillow Group (Z) stock. It is jumped 300% in the last 6 months. Looks like a good candidate to analyze if price rally will sustain for the short/long term.
