## Airline Safety Visualization 
<p align='justify'>Due to recent unfortunate airline crashes, the media has been promoting statistics stating air is no longer a safe way to travel. 
The news and media outlets have been bombarding the public with reports and figures about the trends of airline safety and that things are not looking good. What was previously thought of as the safest way to travel, especially when compared to automobiles, is now being presented as one of the most dangerous to the public. 

Our team looked at the data from different sources to come up with answers to airline safety. </p>
