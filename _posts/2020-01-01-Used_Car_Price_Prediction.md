## Used Car Price Prediction
<p align='justify'>On average, there are 1.88 vehicles per USA household. Owning a car is becoming more and more common worldwide. The current market size of used car vehicles is around $89 billion. The buyer confidence will likely increase over the next five years as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. It is projected that the revenue for used car dealers in the USA will amount to approximately $123.3 billion by the year 2024[1]. In the US alone, there are 123,905 businesses involved in the used car market. Due to the increased price of new cars and customers with a lack of funds, used car sales are on a global increase. Developing countries adopted the lease culture instead of owning a new car due to affordability. Therefore, the rise in used car sales is increasing exponentially. There is an abundance of used car sales data out and available. This project aims at using the multiple attributes of the used cars sold over the years and trains a model that can predict an appropriate price for a used car. Using machine learning algorithms like linear regression, K-Neighbors Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, etc., we aim to build a model that will help in reliably predicting used car price.</p>  

#### DataSets:

Craigslist is the world's largest collection of used vehicles for sale, yet it's very difficult to collect all of them in the same place. I built a scraper for a school project and expanded upon it later to create this dataset which includes every used vehicle entry within the United States on Craigslist.

This data is scraped every few months, it contains most all relevant information that Craigslist provides on car sales including columns like price, condition, manufacturer, latitude/longitude, and 18 other categories.
