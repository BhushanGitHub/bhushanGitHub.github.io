## Brain Tumor Image Classification
<p align='justify'>

Images are used in various fields to make the problem easier to understand. Image processing techniques are most widely 
used in medical imaging to identify the affected area through an X-ray, computed tomography scan(CT scan), 
MRI scan(Magnetic resonance images). These images are used to detect, identify, and locate infections, abnormal growths 
from the human body. Heart diseases, Cancer, Brain tumor, Blood clotting, these are some of the abnormalities that can be 
found by medical imaging techniques. We can use different machine learning techniques to classify different types of brain 
tumors by using MRI. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a class of deep learning neural networks that are highly 
effective with image classifications.

#### DataSets:

The brain tumor dataset contains 2870 training images. The dataset includes the three kinds of tumor images. 
The three tumors have the following distribution of data. -
    
1. 822 Meningioma images. The meningioma type of tumors seen near the top-outer part of the brain. Meningioma is slowly 
growing noncancerous tumors that cause seizures and visual problems. This type of tumors accounting for 37.6% of all 
tumors, and 53.3% of all non-malignant tumors.

2. 826 Glioma images. Glioma is an abnormal growth in glial cells present around the neurons in the brain. Gliomas make 
up 81% of malignant brain tumors in adults.

3. 827 pituitary tumor images. Pituitary tumors grow in pituitary glands that affect body functions. Some pituitary 
tumors result in too many of the hormones that regulate important functions of your body. Some pituitary tumors can 
cause your pituitary gland to produce lower levels of hormones. 

4. 395 No tumor images.
