<p align="justify">Hello, my name is Bhushan. 

After graduating with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering, 
I spent the last fifteen years working as Software Developer and Data Engineer and as part of a team in various companies in the USA, UK, Malaysia, Singapore, and India. I acquired project and time management skills, as well as 
the ability to communicate with team members and clients while effectively meeting milestones and deadlines.

As a Data Engineer, I collaborated with BigData, product, and management teams around the world including onshore and offshore collaboration.

I am currently working in the USA. I am always available to discuss your project and I am just an email away. 
These days I enjoy spending my free time talking a trail walk, cooking different food, and playing with my kids.
